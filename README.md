# bioinformatics-demo-data
Description

This repository contains example FASTA files for bioinformatics tutorials, particularly for environmental omics studies. These datasets are designed for practicing file parsing, sequence analysis, and data manipulation using Python and Biopython.
Files
example1.fasta

This file contains generic nucleotide sequences commonly used for bioinformatics demonstrations, including:

    Parsing FASTA files
    Extracting sequence data
    Computing sequence statistics
    Finding motifs and AT/GC-rich regions

example2.fasta

This file contains real-world-inspired environmental omics data, with metadata annotations including:

    Sample ID
    Source (e.g., marine sediment, hydrothermal vent, soil microbiome, etc.)
    Geographical location
    Collection date
    Organism classification

This dataset is useful for:

    Parsing and extracting sequence metadata
    Environmental microbiome studies
    Nucleotide frequency analysis
    Filtering sequences based on sample attributes

Usage

These files can be used for:

    Learning FASTA file parsing with Biopython
    Automating sequence retrieval tasks
    Practicing command-line sequence manipulation
    Building pipelines for environmental sequence analysis
